%% Problem 1
% As the frequency varies, so does the pitch proportionally. Doubling the
% frequency results in a similar sound but with a higher pitch.
% When we lower the frequency below about 70Hz, it becomes difficult to 
% hear without also increasing the amplitude. Below around 18Hz, it becomes
% inaudible even with a high amplitude. Likewise, above around 20000Hz, it 
% becomes inaudible.
%
% As the amplitude varies, the percieved loudness varies significantly. 
% At around 8V, it becomes painful to hear, and below around 80mV it
% becomes hard to discern.
%
% Varying offset and phase does not seem to affect the sound.
%
% Changing the shape of the waveform changes the "flavour" of the sound -
% sine waves give a sharp sound, square waves a sound reminicent of 8-bit
% chiptunes, ramp sounds similar to sine.
